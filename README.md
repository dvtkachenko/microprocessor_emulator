The object of development is a system for modeling the operation of digital computing structures at a functional level. 

The software package is developed using visual programming tools Builder C ++ and Delphi.

In this project were developed algorithms for modeling the operation of digital computing circuits and program modules of the system.

The result of this work is the development of a simulation system that has sufficient functionality for designing 
and studying the operation of digital computers created on the basis of a microprocessor set of LSI K1804. 

This system is designed to enable the design, construction and debugging of computing structures, 
for which a library of model elements of the K1804 series with the possibility of expansion is provided.
